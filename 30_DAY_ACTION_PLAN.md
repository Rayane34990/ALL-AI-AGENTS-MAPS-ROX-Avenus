### Cold Email Template for Researchers:
```
Subject: Free AI discovery tool - thought you might find this useful

Hi [Name],

I came across your recent work on [specific paper/project] and was impressed by [specific detail]. 

I'm reaching out because I've built something that might be useful for AI researchers like yourself: a comprehensive discovery platform that indexes 1M+ AI models across GitHub, Hugging Face, arXiv, and 12+ other platforms.

Instead of manually searching multiple sites to find relevant models, you can now:
- Search using natural language ("transformer models for text classification")
- Get real-time updates on new models in your area
- Track trends and emerging capabilities
- Export data for research workflows

Demo: [link] (try searching for something in your research area)

The platform is completely free and open source. We're looking for feedback from researchers to make it even more useful.

Would love to hear your thoughts if you get a chance to try it!

Best,
[Your name]
```
