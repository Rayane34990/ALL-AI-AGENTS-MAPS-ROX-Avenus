# ALL AI AGENTS MAPS: ROX AVENUS

## 🚀 The Vision

Welcome to the most ambitious, open-source AI discovery engine ever built. Our mission: **map every AI agent, model, and tool on the planet**—from GitHub, research papers, APIs, and directories—into a unified, living, and searchable knowledge base. This is the Google Maps for AI, built by and for the community.
