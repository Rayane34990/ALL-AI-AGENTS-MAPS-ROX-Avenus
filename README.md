# ALL AI AGENTS MAPS: ROX AVENUS

## 🚀 The Vision

Welcome to the most ambitious, open-source AI discovery engine ever built. Our mission: **map every AI agent, model, and tool on the planet**—from GitHub, research papers, APIs, and directories—into a unified, living, and searchable knowledge base. This is the Google Maps for AI, built by and for the community.

---

## 🌟 Why This Project Matters
- **Democratize AI:** Make the world’s AI resources accessible to everyone, everywhere.
- **Accelerate Progress:** Empower researchers, developers, and creators to discover, compare, and build on the latest AI breakthroughs instantly.
- **Transparency & Trust:** 100% open-source, community-driven, and legally compliant. No black boxes. No gatekeepers.
- **Sustainable & Automated:** Designed for free/low-cost hosting, automated ingestion, and effortless updates.

---

## 💡 What’s Already Possible
- **Unified Search:** Instantly search across GitHub, arXiv, Papers With Code, Hugging Face, ONNX, TensorFlow Hub, Replicate, RapidAPI, and more.
- **Smart Ingestion:** Automated scripts keep the database fresh with the latest models, agents, and tools—no manual work required.
- **Deduplication & Classification:** Advanced logic ensures a clean, organized, and non-redundant knowledge base.
- **Modern Web UI:** Lightning-fast, filterable, exportable, and beautiful. Analytics and agent details at your fingertips.
- **Open REST API:** Integrate, remix, and build on top of the data—no permission needed.
- **Cloud-Native & Automated:** Runs and updates itself in the cloud. No local setup required. Just fork, deploy, and go.

---

## 🔮 The Future: What’s Next
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Personalized agent/model suggestions for every user and use case.
- **Community Curation:** Voting, tagging, and contributions from the global AI community.
- **Deeper Analytics:** Trends, adoption, and impact metrics for every agent and tool.
- **Federated Knowledge:** Connect with other open-source AI directories and knowledge graphs.
- **Education & Onboarding:** Make AI accessible for students, educators, and non-coders.

---

## 🛠️ How to Get Involved
- **Contribute code, ideas, or new data sources.**
- **Use the API and UI to build your own AI-powered apps.**
- **Share feedback and help shape the future of open AI discovery.**

---

## 📚 Documentation & Quickstart
- See the `/docs` folder for contributing guidelines and code of conduct.
- Backend: FastAPI, **PostgreSQL** (via SQLAlchemy), modular ingestion, deduplication, and analytics.
- Frontend: React, advanced search/filter, analytics, and export.
- Automated cloud deployment and updates (see workflows and README instructions).

### PostgreSQL Setup
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`).
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python -m db.models` to initialize tables if needed.
- All ingestion, deduplication, and API scripts now use SQLAlchemy and are cloud-native.

**This is just the beginning. The map of all AI is being drawn—by and for everyone.**
