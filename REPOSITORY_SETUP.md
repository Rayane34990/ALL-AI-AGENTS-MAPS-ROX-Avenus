# Repository Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure your GitHub repository settings to encourage contributions while maintaining control over the project direction.

## Recommended GitHub Settings

### 1. **Branch Protection Rules**
Go to Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule for `main` branch:

```
âœ… Require a pull request before merging
âœ… Require approvals (1-2 reviewers)
âœ… Require review from CODEOWNERS  
âœ… Restrict pushes that create files
âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
âœ… Require linear history
âœ… Include administrators
```

### 2. **Repository Settings**
Go to Settings â†’ General:

```
âœ… Allow merge commits
âœ… Allow squash merging  
âœ… Allow rebase merging
âœ… Always suggest updating pull request branches
âœ… Allow auto-merge
âœ… Automatically delete head branches
```

### 3. **Collaborator Settings**
Go to Settings â†’ Manage access:

```
âœ… Base permissions: Read
âœ… Allow forking: Yes (MIT license encourages this)
âœ… Restrict creation of public forks: No
```

### 4. **Issue Templates**
Already configured in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- `bug_report.yml` - Structured bug reporting
- `feature_request.yml` - Feature suggestions with contribution options

### 5. **Discussion Settings**
Enable GitHub Discussions for:
- Community Q&A
- Feature brainstorming  
- Research collaboration
- Show and tell contributions

### 6. **Security Settings**
Go to Settings â†’ Security & analysis:

```
âœ… Dependency graph
âœ… Dependabot alerts
âœ… Dependabot security updates
âœ… Code scanning alerts
âœ… Secret scanning alerts
```

## Encouraging Contributions Over Forks

### Social Proof Strategy
1. **Highlight Contributors**: Feature top contributors in README
2. **Contribution Stats**: Show contribution metrics prominently
3. **Recognition Program**: Monthly contributor spotlights
4. **Conference Talks**: Present contributors' work at conferences

### Technical Incentives
1. **Easy Setup**: Comprehensive QUICKSTART.md
2. **Good First Issues**: Label beginner-friendly tasks
3. **Mentorship**: Offer guidance for new contributors
4. **Fast Reviews**: Commit to 24-48 hour review times

### Community Building
1. **Regular Meetings**: Monthly contributor video calls
2. **Discord/Slack**: Real-time collaboration channel
3. **Office Hours**: Weekly Q&A sessions with maintainers
4. **Hackathons**: Organize community coding events

## Monitoring and Analytics

### GitHub Insights
Monitor these metrics regularly:
- Fork vs. Contribution ratio
- Pull request merge rate
- Issue response time
- Community engagement

### Encouraging Metrics
- High pull request to fork ratio
- Low number of abandoned forks

## Communication Templates

### Welcome Message for New Contributors
```markdown
ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the AI Knowledge Graph Engine!

Thank you for your interest in contributing. Here's how to get started:

3. Join our community discussions for questions
4. Follow our [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for local setup

We provide mentorship and support for all contributors!
```

### Fork Encouragement Message
```markdown
ðŸ‘‹ We noticed you forked our repository!

While the MIT license gives you full freedom to fork, we'd love to have you contribute directly to this repository instead. Here's why:

âœ… **Recognition**: Your contributions get visibility in a high-impact project
âœ… **Collaboration**: Work directly with AI researchers and engineers  
âœ… **Support**: Get code reviews, mentorship, and technical guidance
âœ… **Impact**: Help build the definitive AI discovery platform

Interested in contributing? Check out our open issues or start a discussion!
```

## Long-term Strategy
