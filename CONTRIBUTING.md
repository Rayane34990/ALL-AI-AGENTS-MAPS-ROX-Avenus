# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the AI Knowledge Graph Engine! This project is open source under the MIT License, which means you're free to use, modify, and distribute the code. However, we encourage all improvements to be contributed back to benefit the entire community.

## Preferred Contribution Workflow

### 1. **Contribute Rather Than Fork**
While the MIT license allows forking, we strongly encourage:
- **Contributing back** to this main repository via pull requests
- **Collaborating** with the core team rather than maintaining separate forks
- **Sharing improvements** so everyone benefits from your work

### 2. **Why Contribute Here?**
- **Visibility**: Your contributions get recognition in a high-profile project
- **Community**: Work with leading AI researchers and engineers
- **Impact**: Help build the definitive AI discovery platform
- **Support**: Get code reviews, feedback, and mentorship from experts

## Getting Started

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riteshroshann/ALL-AI-AGENTS-MAPS-ROX-Avenus.git
cd ALL-AI-AGENTS-MAPS-ROX-Avenus
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

### Before Contributing
1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes
3. **Fork the repository** for your development
4. **Create a feature branch** from main
5. **Follow our coding standards** (see below)

- **Security**: Pass all security scans (bandit, safety)

### Example Function
```python
from typing import List, Optional
import asyncio

async def process_ai_artifacts(
    source: str,
    batch_size: int = 1000,
    max_retries: int = 3
) -> List[AIArtifact]:
    """Process AI artifacts from a given source with error handling.
    
    Args:
        source: Data source identifier (e.g., 'github', 'arxiv')
        batch_size: Number of artifacts to process per batch
        max_retries: Maximum retry attempts for failed requests
        
    Returns:
        List of successfully processed AI artifacts
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If source format is invalid
        ConnectionError: If external API is unreachable
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
