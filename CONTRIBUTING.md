# Contributing to AI Knowledge Graph Engine

We welcome contributions from researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners worldwide. This document outlines our contribution process and standards.

## Overview

The AI Knowledge Graph Engine is a research-grade system for automated AI capability discovery. We maintain high standards for code quality, documentation, and scientific rigor.

## Development Philosophy

- **Research Excellence**: All contributions should advance the state-of-the-art in AI discovery systems
- **Reproducibility**: Code must be reproducible with clear documentation and test coverage
- **Scalability**: Solutions should handle millions of AI artifacts with sub-second response times
- **Open Science**: Transparent, peer-reviewable, and community-driven development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ with type hints
- PostgreSQL 13+ experience
- Familiarity with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts

### Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riteshroshann/ALL-AI-AGENTS-MAPS-ROX-Avenus.git
cd ALL-AI-AGENTS-MAPS-ROX-Avenus
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

### Code Standards

#### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 with 88-character line limit
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Docstrings in Google format
- Minimum 85% test coverage

#### Example Function
```python
from typing import List, Optional
import asyncio

async def process_ai_artifacts(
    source: str,
    batch_size: int = 1000,
    max_retries: int = 3
) -> List[AIArtifact]:
    """Process AI artifacts from a given source with error handling.
    
    Args:
        source: Data source identifier (e.g., 'github', 'arxiv')
        batch_size: Number of artifacts to process per batch
        max_retries: Maximum retry attempts for failed requests
        
    Returns:
        List of successfully processed AI artifacts
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If source format is invalid
        ConnectionError: If external API is unreachable
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Submission Process

### 1. Issue Discussion
Before coding, create an issue to discuss:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Proposed approach and alternatives
- Success metrics and evaluation plan

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/semantic-search-improvement

# Make changes with commits following conventional format
git commit -m "feat(search): implement transformer-based semantic matching

- Add sentence-transformers for query embedding
- Implement cosine similarity ranking
- Add benchmark showing 15% precision improvement
- Include comprehensive unit tests

Closes #123"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/semantic-search-improvement
```

### 3. Pull Request Requirements

#### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests pass (`pytest tests/`)
- [ ] Code coverage â‰¥85% (`pytest --cov=src/`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`mypy src/`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`flake8 src/`, `black src/`)
- [ ] No security issues (`bandit -r src/`)

#### Documentation

- Performance review for optimizations
- Documentation review

## Specific Guidelines

### Adding New Data Sources

1. **Create ingestion module**: `ingest/{source}_ingest.py`
2. **Implement required interface**:
   ```python
   class SourceIngestor(BaseIngestor):
       async def fetch_artifacts(self) -> AsyncIterator[RawArtifact]:
           """Fetch artifacts from source."""
           
       async def parse_artifact(self, raw: RawArtifact) -> AIArtifact:
           """Parse raw data into structured format."""
           
       async def validate_artifact(self, artifact: AIArtifact) -> bool:
           """Validate artifact quality and completeness."""
   ```
3. **Add comprehensive tests**
4. **Update documentation**

### Performance Optimization

1. **Benchmark current performance**:
   ```bash
   python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --target=search
   ```
2. **Implement optimization with metrics**
3. **Verify improvement with statistical significance**
4. **Document performance characteristics**

### Database Schema Changes

1. **Create migration script**: `migrations/v{version}_{description}.py`
2. **Test migration on production-sized dataset**
3. **Document rollback procedure**
4. **Update ORM models and tests**
