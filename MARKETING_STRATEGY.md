### üé• YouTube Content Plan
**Goal**: Demonstrate value through tutorials

**Video Ideas**:
1. **"Find Any AI Model in 30 Seconds"** (2-3 min tutorial)
2. **"I Built the Google for AI - Here's How"** (10 min technical overview)
3. **"Discovering AI Trends Before They Go Viral"** (5 min analytics demo)
4. **"From Idea to AI Model: Complete Research Workflow"** (15 min case study)

### üì∞ LinkedIn Strategy
**Goal**: Reach professional AI community

**Content Types**:
1. **Professional insights** about AI industry trends
2. **Technical articles** about building discovery systems  
3. **Success stories** from researchers using your platform
4. **Industry analysis** based on your aggregated data

**Sample LinkedIn Post**:

üß† AI Discovery Insights: What I Learned Building a Platform That Indexes 1M+ AI Models

After analyzing thousands of AI models across GitHub, Hugging Face, and research labs, here are 5 trends that surprised me:

1. 60% of breakthrough models come from unexpected sources
2. Academic papers lag behind GitHub implementations by 2-3 months
3. Most popular ‚â† most useful (correlation is only 0.3)
4. Cross-platform collaboration is still rare but highly effective
5. Documentation quality is the best predictor of adoption

Building this discovery engine taught me that the AI landscape is both more diverse and more fragmented than anyone realizes.

What trends are you seeing in your AI work?
